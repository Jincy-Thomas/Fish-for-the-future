# Fish for the Future: How the World’s Seafood Supply Is Changing

## Project Overview
The global seafood supply was analyzed from 1960 to 2022, examining the balance between wild-caught fisheries and aquaculture. Regional and income-based production trends were evaluated to understand shifts in supply, highlight ecological limits, and explore opportunities and risks for sustainable seafood production.

## Data Source

Data on seafood production was used:

1. **Capture Fishery Production – FAO via World Bank (2025)**  
   https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/capture-fishery-production  
   *(Processed data used for analysis and visualization)*

2. **Aquaculture Production – FAO via World Bank (2025)**  
   https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/aquaculture-farmed-fish-production  
   *(Processed data used for analysis and visualization)*

The datasets provide annual production volumes by country, region, and income group for both wild-caught fisheries and aquaculture.

## Methodology / What Was Done

- Global seafood production data was collected and cleaned  
- Capture fisheries and aquaculture trends were analyzed by region and income group  
- Historical growth, plateaus, and shifts were calculated and visualized  
- Interactive maps were created for 2022 production by country  
- Insights into ecological limits, regional dominance, and sustainability risks were generated

---

## Key Insights

- Capture fisheries expanded rapidly until the 1990s, plateauing at ~90 million tonnes  
- Aquaculture surged from near zero to over 120 million tonnes, surpassing wild-caught supply for the first time  
- East Asia and South Asia dominate aquaculture, while high-income countries remain more reliant on wild-caught fisheries  
- Oceans have reached ecological limits, making aquaculture critical for future seafood supply  
- The shift toward aquaculture introduces both sustainability opportunities and new environmental pressures
